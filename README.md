# SUV Purchase Prediction Using Logistic Regression

## Project Description
This project utilizes a dataset of SUV purchases to predict whether a user will buy an SUV. The prediction model is built using Logistic Regression, a machine learning algorithm.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `suv_data.csv`. It contains various features that influence the decision to purchase an SUV.

## Dependencies
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run the Python script to train the model and make predictions.

## Results
The Logistic Regression model was able to accurately predict whether a user will buy an SUV based on the given dataset.

## Future Work
Further improvements can be made by tuning the hyperparameters of the Logistic Regression model or by using more complex machine learning algorithms.
